# Simple Interest Calculator

This project provides a simple Bash script to calculate **Simple Interest** based on the given **Principal Amount, Rate of Interest, and Time Period**.

Formula:
The simple interest is calculated using the following formula:
Simple Interest = (P × T × R) / 100
Where:
- **P** = Principal amount
- **T** = Time period (in years)
- **R** = Annual rate of interest (percentage)

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/github-final-project.git
   cd github-final-project
2. Give execute permissions to the script:
   chmod +x simple-interest.sh
3. Run the Script

4. Enter values when prompted:
   Example:
            Enter the principal:
            1000
            Enter rate of interest per year:
            5
            Enter time period in years:
            3
            The simple interest is:
